Freetery is an app which allows users to post about free food. Users can post
about the existence of free food, update the post if something about the food has
changed (location, description, etc), and delete the post once the food is gone.

When posting about free food, users MUST specify the location of the food and may
add other information including a description, group which the food is from, whether
the food is vegan, vegetarian, dairy free, gluten free, or nut free, and any allergens.
All of these fields can be updated.

When browsing the available options, users can filter by a dietary type. In addition, 
the browse panel will sort by distance of the users location to location. In 
order to accomplish this, we will use the Google Maps API which allows us to calculate
the straight line distance from the user's location to the location of the food

The implementation of the backend will be the following:

db.py: 
  class Users (db.Model):
    Model representing users of the app.

    Columns: id, OAuth? requirements

  class Posts (db.Model):
    Model representing posts about free food. 
    
    A many to one relationship with location 

    A many to one relationship with users

    Columns: id, description, image URL, vegan, vegetarian, gluten free, dairy 
    free, nut free, allergens

  class Location (db.Model):
    Model representing the location of food. A one to many relationship with posts.

    Columns: id, name, coordinates (latitude, longitude for google)

app.py:
  GET /posts/ gets all posts
  GET /users/ gets all users
  GET /posts/<int:id>/ gets information about a specific post
  GET /users/<int:id>/ gets information about a specific user
  GET /posts/filter/ gets all posts of free food with some dietary restrictions
  GET /posts/filter/sort/ gets posts of some dietary restrictions sorted by distance

  POST /posts/ to create a new post
  POST /user/ to create a new user

  UPDATE /posts/<int:id>/ updates a post with id
  UPDATE /users/<int:id>/ updates a user with id

  DELETE /posts/<int:id>/ to delete a post
  DELETE /posts/closed/ deletes all food at a location
